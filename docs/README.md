# BuildRight Color Palette Previews

This folder contains interactive preview pages showing four color palette options for the BuildRight construction platform.

## Files

- `index.html` - Landing page with links to all previews
- `theme-exploration/` - Directory containing all theme exploration files:
  - `palette-comparison.html` - Side-by-side comparison of all four options
  - `palette-option-1-preview.html` - Professional Blue + Safety Orange
  - `palette-option-2-preview.html` - Modern Slate + Vibrant Accents
  - `palette-option-3-preview.html` - Deep Blue + Warm Orange (Current)
  - `palette-option-4-preview.html` - Industrial Gray + Electric Blue
  - `color-palette-preview.html` - Comprehensive color palette exploration

## Viewing Locally

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser, or open any of the preview files directly.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the `wip` branch. See the main `README.md` for deployment details.

Theme exploration files are accessible at `/docs/theme-exploration/` on the deployed site.

## Cleanup

To remove these previews:
- Delete this `/docs` folder from your repository
- Or disable GitHub Pages in Settings → Pages

These files are kept in the repository for reference and are accessible via GitHub Pages, but are organized separately from the main site content.
