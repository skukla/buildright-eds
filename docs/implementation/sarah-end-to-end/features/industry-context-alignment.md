## 🔍 Real-World Context Research

### Q2: What drives Sarah's package selection in the real world?

**Research Sources**: Production builder workflows, subdivision requirements, industry standards

#### Real-World Package Selection Drivers

**1. Subdivision Covenants (Primary Driver)**
```
Desert Ridge Subdivision (Example):
├─ Required: Tile roof, stucco exterior, Pella windows
├─ Approved: 3 color palettes, 2 door styles
└─ Result: "Desert Ridge Premium Package" is PRE-CONFIGURED
```

**Key Insight**: Sarah doesn't "choose" packages creatively. **Subdivision rules dictate 80% of selections.**

**2. Builder Brand Standards (Secondary Driver)**
```
Sunset Valley Homes (Sarah's employer):
├─ Standard Package: Builder's Choice (budget-conscious)
├─ Premium Package: Subdivision-specific (meets covenants)
├─ Executive Package: Luxury upgrade (marketing differentiator)
└─ Result: Packages are COMPANY POLICY, not personal preference
```

**Key Insight**: Sarah picks from **3 pre-approved company packages**, not hundreds of products.

**3. Cost vs. Market Price (Decision Factor)**
```
Scenario: Sarah building "The Sedona" in Desert Ridge
├─ Base cost: $225,000 (materials + labor)
├─ Sale price: $425,000 (market rate)
├─ Profit margin: $200,000 (47%)
├─ Premium package adds: $18,000 (+8% to cost)
├─ Sale price increase: $35,000 (+8% to price)
├─ Net impact: +$17,000 profit per house
└─ Decision: USE PREMIUM PACKAGE (higher margin)
```

**Key Insight**: Sarah calculates **cost-to-margin impact**, not absolute cost.

**4. Construction Phase Timing (Practical Driver)**
```
Build Timeline:
├─ Week 1-3: Foundation & Framing (order together)
├─ Week 4-6: Envelope (windows/doors arrive early)
├─ Week 7-10: Interior Finish (order closer to install)
└─ Sarah orders by PHASE, not all at once
```

**Key Insight**: Phase-based ordering is **operational necessity** (storage space, delivery scheduling).

#### How This Impacts UI Design

**DON'T Design**:
- ❌ Endless product grids to "browse"
- ❌ Aesthetic comparison ("Which door looks better?")
- ❌ Individual SKU selection (too granular)
- ❌ Creative customization tools

**DO Design**:
- ✅ **Package comparison cards** (3 pre-defined options)
- ✅ **Cost delta display** (+$18K for premium)
- ✅ **Margin calculator** (optional future feature: "adds $17K profit")
- ✅ **Phase selection checkboxes** (Foundation, Envelope, Interior)
- ✅ **Subdivision compliance badge** ("Meets Desert Ridge covenants")

---

### Q3: How are BOMs organized in the real world for production builders?

**Research Sources**: Construction management software (Buildertrend, CoConstruct, Procore), industry best practices

#### Real-World BOM Organization Patterns

**Pattern 1: CSI MasterFormat (Industry Standard)**
```
CSI Division Structure (48 divisions):
├─ Division 03: Concrete
├─ Division 04: Masonry
├─ Division 06: Wood, Plastics, Composites
├─ Division 07: Thermal & Moisture Protection
├─ Division 08: Openings (doors/windows)
├─ Division 09: Finishes
└─ ... (28 more divisions)
```

**Use Case**: Large commercial projects, government contracts  
**Complexity**: High (48 divisions, 100+ subcategories)  
**Fits Sarah?**: ❌ **Too complex** for residential production builders

---

**Pattern 2: Construction Phase Grouping (Most Common for Residential)**
```
Phase-Based BOM:
├─ Phase 1: Foundation & Framing
│   ├─ Concrete & Rebar
│   ├─ Lumber (studs, plates, beams)
│   ├─ Fasteners & Hardware
│   └─ Sheathing
├─ Phase 2: Building Envelope
│   ├─ Windows & Doors
│   ├─ Roofing Materials
│   ├─ Siding & Trim
│   └─ Waterproofing
└─ Phase 3: Interior Finish
    ├─ Drywall & Insulation
    ├─ Flooring
    ├─ Paint & Finishes
    └─ Fixtures & Hardware
```

**Use Case**: Residential production builders (like Sarah)  
**Complexity**: Low (3-4 phases, 8-12 categories)  
**Fits Sarah?**: ✅ **PERFECT** - matches delivery schedule, storage logistics

---

**Pattern 3: Cost Code Grouping (Accounting-Focused)**
```
Cost Code BOM:
├─ 100-Series: Site Work ($12K)
├─ 200-Series: Foundation ($18K)
├─ 300-Series: Framing ($45K)
├─ 400-Series: Exterior ($38K)
├─ 500-Series: Interior ($28K)
└─ Total: $141K
```

**Use Case**: Budget tracking, accounting integration  
**Complexity**: Medium (10-15 cost codes)  
**Fits Sarah?**: ⚠️ **Secondary view** - useful for finance team, not material ordering

---

**Pattern 4: Trade-Based Grouping (Subcontractor-Focused)**
```
Trade BOM:
├─ Concrete Contractor
│   └─ Concrete, rebar, forms
├─ Framing Contractor
│   └─ Lumber, fasteners, sheathing
├─ Roofing Contractor
│   └─ Shingles, underlayment, flashing
├─ Electrical Contractor
│   └─ Wire, boxes, panels
└─ ... (8-12 trades)
```

**Use Case**: Commercial construction, custom homes  
**Complexity**: Medium (8-12 trades)  
**Fits Sarah?**: ❌ **Not needed** - Sarah orders ALL materials at once (not per trade)

---

#### Recommended Pattern: **Phase-Based with Category Sub-Grouping**

**Why This Works for Sarah**:
1. **Matches delivery schedule** - Order Foundation materials → delivered Week 1
2. **Reduces storage needs** - Don't receive all materials at once
3. **Simplifies ordering** - "Order Phase 1 for Houses 47-50"
4. **Enables cloning** - "Reorder Phase 2 from House #45"
5. **Familiar mental model** - Sarah thinks in construction phases

**UI Structure**:

## 🎯 Alignment Confirmation

### Are We Tackling the Right Things?

**YES** ✅ According to the original plan:
- Phase 6A focuses on Sarah's UI/UX redesign
- Design work comes BEFORE implementation
- Backend integration (buildright-service) is a Phase 7-8 concern
- We're correctly in the "design screens and interactions" phase

### Is the Integration Work for Future Phases?

**YES** ✅ The documents we created earlier are for:
- **BACKEND-INTEGRATION-ANALYSIS.md** → Use in Sub-Phase 4 (BOM generation implementation)
- **UPDATED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** → Use in Sub-Phases 3-4 (when building, not designing)
- **INTEGRATION-SUMMARY.md** → Use in Sub-Phase 7 (final integration)

They are **correctly captured** and **waiting for the right phase**.
