# BuildRight Persona Implementation - Meta Plan

## Overview

This meta-plan orchestrates the implementation of the BuildRight persona-driven experience across 7 major phases and 13 implementation plans. Each phase is designed to be independently testable with clear success criteria.

**Key Principle**: All ACO (Adobe Commerce Optimizer) connections are **MOCKED** in this implementation. The mock should closely mirror the eventual production behavior to enable seamless transition.

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Research & Architecture Decisions
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Plan Document**: `PHASE-0-RESEARCH-AND-DECISIONS.md`

## Mock ACO Strategy

**Critical**: All ACO interactions are mocked in this implementation.

### What Gets Mocked

1. **Product Catalog API**
   - Mock service returns products with persona-specific attributes
   - Simulates ACO's attribute filtering

2. **Pricing API**
   - Mock service returns customer-group-specific pricing
   - Includes volume tier calculations

3. **Triggered Policies (CCDM)**
   - Mock service simulates progressive catalog filtering
   - Shows visual loading states
   - Returns filtered product sets based on user selections

4. **Customer/User API**
   - Mock service returns user context with customer group
   - Simulates authentication state

### How to Build Mocks

**Principle**: Mock the eventual ACO API structure as closely as possible.

```javascript
// Example: Mock ACO service should return data in ACO format
mockACOService.getProducts({
  policy: 'deck_rectangular',
  userContext: { customerGroup: 'retail_homeowner' }
})
// Returns products in ACO response format
```

**Benefits**:
- When real ACO is connected, we swap mock for real API calls
- Data structures remain the same
- Frontend code doesn't change
- Testing validates expected API behavior

### Mock Data Sources

- `data/mock-products.json` - Generated from buildright-aco
- `scripts/aco-service.js` - Mock API implementation
- `scripts/persona-config.js` - User/customer group mappings

---

## Testing Strategy

Each phase has specific testing requirements defined in its plan document.

### Phase-Level Testing

✅ **Phase 0**: Architecture decision documents reviewed and approved  
✅ **Phase 1**: Data validation scripts pass  
✅ **Phase 2**: Visual QA for all icons  
✅ **Phase 3**: Unit tests for persona config and mock ACO  
✅ **Phase 4**: Component isolation testing  
✅ **Phase 5**: Page-level regression testing  
✅ **Phase 6A-6E**: Persona flow end-to-end testing  
✅ **Phase 7**: Cross-persona integration testing

### Integration Testing (Phase 7)

- All 5 personas work end-to-end
- No cross-persona state contamination
- Mock ACO responds correctly for all scenarios
- Customer group pricing displays correctly
- Triggered policies filter as expected

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Dropin Integration**: Adobe Commerce Dropins may have learning curve
   - **Mitigation**: Phase 0 research, start with documentation

2. **Mock ACO Accuracy**: Mock may not match real ACO behavior
   - **Mitigation**: Review ACO API docs, validate with Adobe team

3. **Cross-Persona State**: Personas may contaminate each other's state
   - **Mitigation**: Strict isolation testing in Phase 7

4. **Scope Creep**: Each persona could expand beyond plan
   - **Mitigation**: Stick to defined success criteria per phase

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **Image Asset Sourcing**: May be difficult to find appropriate images
   - **Mitigation**: Start image search early, have placeholder strategy

2. **Performance**: Multiple dynamic blocks may impact performance
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing in Phase 7, lazy loading strategy
