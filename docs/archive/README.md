# Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation that is no longer relevant to the current **Persona-Based BuildRight Implementation Plan** but is preserved for historical reference.

## Archive Organization

### `old-project-builder/`
**Archived on:** November 15, 2025  
**Reason:** These documents describe the old "Kit Mode" architecture and Project Builder implementation that is being replaced by the new persona-based approach.

**Contents:**
- Original Project Builder Enhancement plan
- Kit Mode architecture documentation
- Various project builder refactoring plans, audits, and tile implementations

**Note:** The new implementation uses generic wizards and builders that adapt based on user context, replacing the monolithic Project Builder.

### `product-images/`
**Archived on:** November 15, 2025  
**Reason:** Product image mapping documentation. While images are still needed, these specific maps and guides are not directly relevant to the persona implementation architecture.

**Contents:**
- Complete product image maps
- Photo-realistic image guides
- Product image sources and needs documentation

**Note:** Image guidelines remain in the main docs folder (`image-guidelines.md`).

### `theme-exploration-old/`
**Archived on:** November 15, 2025

**Contents:**
- Color palette previews (4 options)
- Palette comparison HTML files

**Note:** The finalized design system is documented in `CSS-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

- Duplicate header fix documentation and script
- DOM manipulation reduction strategy

**Note:** These fixes are now incorporated into the codebase.

---

### `old-routing/`
**Archived on:** November 15, 2025  
**Reason:** URL routing and AEM EDS routing documentation that may be outdated with the new persona-based routing approach using user context and query parameters.

**Contents:**
- AEM EDS routing documentation
- URL migration guides
- URL routing implementation plans

**Note:** The new routing approach is documented in `PERSONA-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (Phase 3 & 5).

---

### `old-audits/`
**Archived on:** November 15, 2025  
**Reason:** Historical code audits and implementation reviews from earlier iterations.

**Contents:**
- Code audit findings
- Implementation review

**Note:** The current UX audit and vision is in `UX-AUDIT-AND-VISION.md`.
